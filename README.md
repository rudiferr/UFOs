# "UFOs" Week 11 Challenge
## Overview of the Project
The client requested a dashboard featuring a filterable table to organize and parese through UFO data that was stored in a JavaScript array. The website was created through Javascript while aesthetics of the website were controlled through HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Results

Upon landing on the website, the user is presented with all of the UFO information gathered.

By using the filters on the side, the user is able to sort through the data using various criteria.

The user can apply multiple criteria at a time to get more precise results.

## Summary
Though, unfortunately due to the data stored and due to the nature of the input fields being case-sensitive, there are some unintuitive results that can happen from mis-capitalization; this also happens if inputs are properly mis-spaced.

One recommendation to address this issue would be to create a dropdown list the user could interact with that is pre-populated with data from the array. Another recommendation to improve website usability would be to change the datetime field to something that is used in Google Forms, where users can chose a precise datetime rather than needing to manually input one.
